solving links.hs from yesod book - chapter basic
1. Pages should have its own page, not on a same file in links.hs
2. I'd better just stack build and setup package.yaml
   1. Tried: stack runghc, importing package: not working
   2. Tried: stack runghc, -i to import module: deprecated?
   3. delete all and just modify package.yaml --> working
3. Cycling import error!
   1. home -> p1 -> p2 -> home
   2. new Routing file should be imported for each page
   3. while dividing a single page code to multi-page code, I totally missed the structure.
4. Haskell namespacing
   1. Haskell prevents name conflicts by module namespacing.
5. Variable not in scope: getHomeR, each page!!!1
   1. Oh, I got lost...
   2. i put every page into a single LinksRoutes file, it works.
   3. Why????
   4. Yesod.core did not work, Yesod worked for multi-page.
   5. Page distinguishing -- TODO.
