1. this week - suffered trying to import control
    -- basic haskell package, no change to package.yaml needed.
2. package path -- from root folder, not source app folder
    -- clean way to track path

first time using custom cassius
    since most of them be static: external file import is recommended
    cassius over js-like css control looks good
    using toWidget [somehowParseCSS|style.css|]?

logging success, i'd better link it to log file.

shouldLogIO to log on a server bash
    -- to file - using maybe pipelining with >?
$logDebug be loved
$logInfo much time
